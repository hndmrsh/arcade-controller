Size of Philips 190S (as example):
Width : 424 mm
Height : 361 mm
Depth : 65.1 mm

- need room on top bezel for power cable to come out and connect to bottom of box

Control panel should be 580mm across



Shrink dimensions down to 50*50*50cm

Need to decide whether to have the monitor face straight ahead when the top is open, or angle upwards (e.g. sit flat inside the lid)
