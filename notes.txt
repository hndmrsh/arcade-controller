Size of Philips 190S (as example):
Width : 424 mm
Height : 361 mm
Depth : 65.1 mm

- need room on top bezel for power cable to come out and connect to bottom of box

Need to decide whether to have the monitor face straight ahead when the top is open, or angle upwards (e.g. sit flat inside the lid)

Sides of box should be joined using finger joints
Top and bottom of box should be attached using housing/dado joints, e.g.: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOBX8_zQitE
